# Problem Statement

This project aims to develop a more effective method for identifying bot accounts on social media, by leveraging data analysis to address issues such as spam, scams, malware, and state-actor propaganda. 

# Business case : 

The business case for this project revolves around safeguarding the social
media platform's ecosystem. By deploying a more effective method to
identify and combat bot accounts, the project aims to reduce spam, scams,
and propaganda, fostering a safer online environment. This can attract and
retain users, improve platform reputation, and potentially increase
advertising revenue as users engage more confidently with authentic
content. Additionally, addressing these issues aligns with regulatory
compliance and ethical considerations, enhancing the platform's
credibility.

# Project Goal 

By the end of this project, we'll develop a ~95% accurate bot detection 
model which will be trained by more than 1M data with 15+ features that will help to reduce
spams in online social media.
